            <p class="p1">Aims: This project aims to uncover significant correlations, or interesting relationships,
                between countries through their states of pollution, health, and wealth. I think the way pollution links
                to different levels of health and wealth will be different across the world. Many countries have
                accumulated wealth through huge pollution, such as the UK. However some of the richest nations with the
                longest life expectancies today are historically environmentally-friendly, such as Finland.
                Additionally, some very poor countries have low pollution and bad health, or high pollution and bad
                health. There are non-uniform connections between these three major topics, which makes them interesting
                to collectively investigate. (103 words)</p>

            <p class="p1">Data: Given the worldly significance of Pollution, Health, and Wealth, there is a multitude of
                useful, clearly presented, and niche data across many reputable sources. I downloaded CSV files

            <p class="description">This chart looks at various countries' emissions of Greenhouse Gases as categorised
                into six groups in the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/dev/1923119.pdf" target="_blank" id="kp">Kyoto
                    Protocol</a>. I have chosen a selction of countries which vary economically, in terms of their Human
                Development Indexes, and in terms of health. As such, this visualisation represents a platform from
                which further analysis shall take place, but will mainly serve to understand why countries have certain
                health and wealth statuses in relation to their pollution levels. A key observation is that absolute
                economic output is certainly linked to pollution - with the US and China by far the two largest
                economies in the world and the biggest historical polluters. This is similar for India and Russia for
                example. However, all four have very different health profiles and income levels per household. (142

                (2019)
            </h3>
            <p>
            <p class="description"> The world wants to understand more than ever how pollution affects our planet, as
                well as human beings. It may seem logical that in countries with loads of pollution per area unit, there
                are higher pollution-related death rates. However, as shown in the regression below, there is a
                basically insignificant positive correlation, with a 0.02 R squared value. A lot of the countries with
                high pollution exposure are notably poor African and Asian ones, yet many have low
                environment-attributable deaths. This may be because, for every 1000 deaths, given the countries are so
                poor, there are many other sources of death like malnutrition which diminish the figure. (107 words)

            <p class="description">
                To try and understand the relationship between pollution and health, one needs to look at more aspects
                shaping countries. In the visualisation below, it is striking that those countries polluting more per
                capita have higher HDI values. HDI is very closely correlated with health, especially given health is a
                component of HDI. This changes the perspective on pollution and health: today's rich countries are very
                healthy, and often to get there they have polluted a large amount, and most likely still are. (91 words)

            <p class="description">Shown below is a very weak, insignificant correlation between total historical Carbon
                Dioxide Emissions and Life Expectancy. I think this may signifiy a few things. Firstly, it is not
                necessarily the case that countries which pollute a lot can get rich and then get healthy. It is
                intersting to think about: pollution itself in an immediate sense, absent of good health and quality of
                life everyone knows is bad for you. This seems to be reflected in Sub-Saharan African nations for
                example. However, the US and Germany have high life expectancies, with their wealth and subsequent good
                health systems subsiding negative health impacts from health pollution in the long run. (117 words)
