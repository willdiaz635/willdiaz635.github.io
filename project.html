            <p id="p1">This project will investigate various data on pollution and health, ultimately aiming to discover
                relationships and uncover any correlations between the two.</p>

                    <li>Pollution types e.g. co2, methane, co, water, land and trends over time by country. This is to
                        make sure there aren't any countries with say loads of air pollution but perfectly clean land.
                        As such 'pollution' captures all types. <a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/">data:

                        is now very developed but has polluted the most over time.</li>
                    <li>C02 emissions per capita and doctors per 1,000 people. Are currently highly polluting countries
                        less developed?</li>
                    <li>Pollution and happiness by country (over time or a bar chart for a year)</li>
                    <li>Recent pollution and economic growth rates - do countries currently polluting heavily grow
                        quickly? Can we expect their health to increase in the future like for the UK and US?</li>
