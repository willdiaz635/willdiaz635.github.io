                Development Indexes, and in terms of health. As such, this visualisation represents a platform from
                which further analysis shall take place, but will mainly serve to understand why countries have certain
                health statuses in relation to their pollution levels.</p>

                (2019)
            </h3>
            <p>
            <p class="description">
                The low R squared value in this visualisation signifies a positive but basically insignificant
                positive relationship between pollution exposure and pollution-attributable deaths in a population. In
                some sense, I don't think this is surprising, as given the complexities and multitide of entire
                countries socioeconomically and developmentally, I would expect many other variables to be at play. Two
                examples within the data and my qualitative assessments: Niger has one of the highest exposures but
                lowest attributable-death rates. This doesn't mean pollution doesn't cause death here, but if we think
                about Niger, it is highly under-developed, with only around 50% of the population having access to clean
                water. As such, out of every 1,000,000 inhabitants, there is likely to be many other variables causing
                death. Secondly, there is undoubtedly a cluster of Central and Eastern European nations with farily low
                exposure levels but high attributable-death rates. This may compliment the Niger observation - take
                Ukraine - less developed than Finland which has low exposure and death rates, but far more developed
                than Niger, and so deaths from common illnesses (e.g. flu) are seldom, thus opening space for
                environment-related deaths, for which healthcare isn't great enough to subside.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Additionally, exposure levels look around 20-60% higher in Eastern compared to Western Europe. Comparing
                to Belgium for example, deaths are far lower although exposure similar. This result reflects possible
                wider differences between the countries, such as healthcare and nutrition, better states of which may
                explain lower attributable death rates. The existence of countless other variables means we are pushed
                to understand the bigger picture within which pollution and health exist, which is attmpted in my next
                visualisation.

            <p class="description">
            <p class="description">
                To try and understand the relationship between pollution and health, one needs to look at more aspects
                shaping countries. In the visualisation below, it is striking that those countries polluting more per
                capita have higher HDI values. HDI is very closely correlated with health, especially given health is a
                component of HDI. This changes the perspective on pollution and health: today's rich countries are very
                healthy, and often to get there they have polluted a large amount, and most likely still are.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                This isn't to say pollution is good for you. Of course fine particulate Greenhouse Gas matter one would
                expect to be bad for you. This motivates one to look at more focused data sets, in the belief there must
                be evidence, given fewer confounding variables, that pollution is bad for you.
