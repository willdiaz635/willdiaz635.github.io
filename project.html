            <p>This chart looks at various countries' emissions of Greenhouse Gases as categorised into six groups in
                the Kyoto Protocol (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/dev/1923119.pdf"></a>). I have chosen a selction of
                countries which vary economically, in terms of their Human Development Indexes, and in terms of health.
                As such, this visualisation represents a platform from which further analysis shall take place, but will
                mainly serve to understand why countries have certain health statuses in relation to their pollution
                levels.</p>
